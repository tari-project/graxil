# Changelog:
# - v1.0.1 (2025-06-15): Added SHA-256 support.
#   - Added sha2 = "0.10.8" dependency for SHA-256 algorithm implementation.
#   - Updated package description to include SHA-256 and Bitcoin support.
# - v1.0.0 (2025-06-14): Initial configuration for modular breakout.
#   - Purpose: Configures the sha3x-miner project, specifying metadata,
#     dependencies, and build settings for the CPU miner.
#   - Features: Defines dependencies for core mining (e.g., sha3, tokio),
#     optional TUI support via feature flag, and a single binary target.
#     Sets rust-version to 1.85 for 2024 edition compatibility.
#   - Note: Updated sha3 to 0.10.8 for stable dependency resolution, ensuring
#     compatibility with SHA3x hashing requirements.
